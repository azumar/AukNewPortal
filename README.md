This is Java EE Project Following the principle of Model View Controller (MVC). In the project, I also applied the principle of model driven development. Thus, the database was model in MySQL benchmark, forward engineered to create Entities for the projects. Thus the entities were derived from the databased tables and the database tables were generated from models. The project was used few years back as the basis for the Application Portal used by Al-Qalam University Katsina.
